# YetAnotherBot
OwO (The extremely popular osu! bot) Rewritten and copied from scratch in C#. Why? because owo has way too many restrictions and doesnt work 30% of the time, enough for it to be extremely annoying so i made my own. Yeah im venting lol, also code is extremely spaghetti so i'm gonna tidy it up some time. Okay so i dont know how to use github, but the bot works as plugin based, the Bot knows about BotPluginBase, but basically the plugin itself doesn't know about the bot, The osu! plugin needs to have https://github.com/Francesco149/oppai-ng to be in the base directory (where the bot exe is) for it to work, also don't forget to put your osu v1 api key in Credentials.cs and discord bot api key in the other Credentials.cs
